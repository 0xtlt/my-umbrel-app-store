description: >-
  n8n is an extendable workflow automation tool. With a fair-code distribution model, n8n will always have visible source code, 
  be available to self-host, and allow you to add your own custom functions, logic and apps. 
  n8n's node-based approach makes it highly versatile, enabling you to connect anything to everything.
  n8n (pronounced n-eight-n) helps you to connect any app with an API with any other, and manipulate its data with little or no code.
  Customizable: highly flexible workflows and the option to build custom nodes.
  
  
  Privacy-focused: self-host n8n for privacy and security.
